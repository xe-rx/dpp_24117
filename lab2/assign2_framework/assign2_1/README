ASSIGNMENT 2.1 FRAMEWORK - README
    Distributed and Parallel Programming 2022

In this folder, you can find the framework for the first sub-assignment of
assignment 2. You are supposed to parallelize the wave equation simulation
again, this time using CUDA to parallelize it on the GPU.

Your can write your code in simulate.cu, but please do not change any of the
other files for grading purposes. If you want to add extra files that need
extra compilation, that is allowed, but please change the Makefile and hand it
in, and be sure to note in your report that you did. Additionally, by default,
the framework runs on a GTX Titan X on the DAS5, which has compute capability
5.2. If you want to use another GPU, or want to run locally on another GPU,
please change the COMPUTE variable in the Makefile to match the correct compute
capability (this should be the version minus the dot - so for the Titan X, this
becomes '52'). Alternatively, if you append 'COMPUTE=X' to your make command,
then the compute capability is set to value X for one run only. Note that you
may have to rebuild from scratch for it to work, i.e., run 'make clean' first.

To make the assignment, use:
    make
or
    make assign2_1

If you want to build the vector-add example, use:
    make vector-add

To run the assignment locally with a few test parameters (check 'RUNARGS' in
the Makefile), use:
    make runlocal
or, for the DAS5:
    make run

Like in the previous assignments, you can show a plot of the last run using:
    make plot

Finally, if you run into weird behaviour or it seems like your changes have no
effect, try building from scratch by first removing all compiled files and
results:
    make clean
It is good practise to always run 'make clean' before you hand in your
assignment, to avoid handing in machine-specific compiled files and files that
will be overwritten when your code runs anyway.
